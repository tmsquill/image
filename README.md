# Image

Convenient image pre-processing for DSLR & Mirrorless cameras. Digital cameras typically write images in JPEG & RAW formats. Interacting with high-megapixel images (especially in RAW format) on older hardware can be a frustrating experience.

The `image` tool provides dead-simple reviewing, selecting, and organizing capabilities that run smoothly on older hardware.

## How It Works

At a high level, `image` takes one argument; a path to a directory containing __JPEG & RAW__ images. The tool will load __JPEG__ images one-by-one and display them using OpenCV.

One of the following actions can be taken for each image:

- `Keep an Image` by pressing the `k` key. This _discards_ the __JPEG__ version of the image but _keeps_ the __RAW__ version.
- `Discard an Image` by pressing the `d` key. This _discards_ both the __JPEG & RAW__ versions of the images.

### Facial Detection

An optional `--facial-detection` flag can be passed to `image` to detect faces. Images containing faces that are kept are stored inside a sub-directory.

### Keeping Options

By default, `image` will discard __JPEG__ files and keep __RAW__ files. This functionality can be tuned with the `--keep-jpeg/--no-keep-jpeg` and `--keep-raw/--no-keep-raw` flags respectively.

Options:
  --facial-detection / --no-facial-detection
                                  Enables facial detection, images with faces
                                  are saved to the 'facial_detections' sub-
                                  directory.

  --keep-jpeg / --no-keep-jpeg    Keep JPEG version of images selected by the
                                  user to keep.

  --keep-raw / --no-keep-raw      Keep RAW version of images selected by the
                                  user to keep.
